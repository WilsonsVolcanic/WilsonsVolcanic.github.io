<h2><u>Overview:</u></h2>
<p>
We were challenged with designing, building and testing a miniature satellite to fit inside a regular soft drink can.  We were given the primary mission, which stated that our design had to measure air pressure and ambient temperature and had to develop a secondary mission to investigate or create anything we wanted. We chose to use a wide range of electronic components such as a methane gas sensor, magnetometer, humidity sensor and a GPS module to be able to determine whether volcanoes are active or not and extended this to volcanic activity on other planets. Our chosen mission is highly relevant, primarily due to the great strides that are being made to develop civilisation on Mars.
As part of the design process, we expected to face some issues, but we couldn’t have predicted the barrage of problems we would have to overcome. Despite this, we were able to produce a finished product to launch, something that many teams around the continent weren’t able to do due to the constraints of the pandemic.
Once we had coded, designed, and manufactured our creation, it was time for the launch. We were given the amazing opportunity to go all the way to York to witness our hard work being launched 450m into the sky. We all agreed that it was a fantastic learning opportunity, and due to the brilliant weather conditions, the launch went as expected - the parachute worked perfectly, and our components were safely recovered. We now have important and exciting data to analyse as part of our final report write-up.
We immensely enjoyed the whole competition, run jointly by the European Space Agency and Esero-UK, and the experience allowed us to develop our time and project management skills, learn how to work effectively in a team, and get a feel for project work in an engineering-related career by, for example, talking to engineers from Raptor Aerospace. We are looking forward to doing it all again in the coming year.

<h2><u>Secondary Mission:</u></h2>
<p>
Evidence for biology on extraterrestrial planets can be suggested by methane concentrations being over a certain ‘threshold’ value. Explaining any values higher than this threshold value would be difficult to explain considering the short atmospheric lifespan of CH4.  However, scientists are exploring the possibilities of false positives for methane biosignatures. An alternative source of methane that could be providing these false-positive results is volcanoes. The generation of CH4 in deep-sea hydrothermal vents was used to further investigate the prospects of false-positive CH4 biosignatures. The research concluded that there is a small chance of >10 Tmol CH4 yr−1 however abiotic levels of CH4 on Earth evidence that these estimations are unreasonably large. (Higher levels of CH4 were likely detected because of the following two reasons: catalysed reactions between H2 and Carbon and the biology present. Lab recreations of the reaction between H2 and Carbon showed that uncatalysed, the reaction is extremely slow.)

Data from the Monte Carlo simulations provided evidence for an increased likelihood of volcanic fluxes of CH4 being comparable to biological CH4 fluxes in environments with larger magma production rates. Noticeable changes in CH4 normally corresponded to changes in CO and H2O. Therefore detecting a large concentration of CO in an atmosphere could suggest that high concentrations of CH4 were abiotic, and if not detected, it could suggest the presence of biology. Unfortunately, a CO sensor within the project’s budget and size requirement was unable to be found and so it was decided to use the necessary compromise of a humidity sensor instead. Volcanic activity releases a huge amount of water vapour, and so measuring this would give an indication of the activity of the volcano and whether the CH4 present in the planet’s atmosphere was biotic or abiotic. For example, if as the device nears the volcano methane and water vapour concentration increase, it can be assumed that the methane detected in Mars’ atmosphere is due to volcanic activity. However, if high humidity levels are not detected, it could be assumed that the CH4 concentration in the area exists due to biology. Furthermore, the drone can be equipped with a magnetometer to provide further evidence of volcanic activity (volcanic eruptions can lead to short term changes in magnetic fields which can be detected. These can be caused by fluid vapourisation and stress changes in volcanic rock.)  Rovers may not be able to climb the rocky and potentially steep terrain of a volcano so implementing this technology inside a small rocket or drone is ideal. While drones can not currently fly efficiently in atmospheres as thin as Mars, the technology to do so is being developed at a rapid rate. All of the detectors were small and light enough for the CanSat and so potentially for the drone.

<h2><u>Statements from the team:</u></h2>
<p>
Sanuka Gunawardena - Team leader, CanSat design
<br><br>Over the course of the project, I have learnt new skills such as leadership and teamwork. I have also significantly improved my CAD skills and become more familiar with professional tools such as Fusion 360. This was my first time using an Arduino so throughout, I made sure to ask as many questions from other team members who were more familiar so that I could learn as much as possible. This will be very important in future projects of mine. 
  <br><br>

Ansh Arora - Software and Electrical lead
<br><br>Not only have I learnt to program in a completely new language, but I also was able to learn to use hardware and components that I can directly control with software. This was particularly fun as I had no prior experience with using an arduino, and I also developed my collaboration, time management, and problem solving skills throughout the project as I closely worked with both the software and electrical team members in order to solve problems and successfully create the cansat. Naturally, the launch itself was very enjoyable, but i also enjoyed researching and using an arduino, as i learnt a lot about low level software protocols and the intricacies of the hardware, which we then applied in the cansat itself.
<br><br>

<p>
Srijan Tyagi - programming
<br><br>I learned how to code in C++ and how to work in a team environment, my skills in problem solving have been refined as I encountered several issues when programming and designing the software. The most challenging part of the project was finding an idea which was feasible for our budget for the secondary mission, in the end, after several discussions and brainstorms, I was satisfied by the result. I enjoyed launching the Cansat the most as I felt relieved and proud seeing months of hard work finally be put into fruition.
<br><br>

<p>
Arya Labroo - Electrical design
<br><br>During this project, I have learnt how to work in larger teams, which involves tasks being split up, deadlines that have to be met, delegation etc which is very important in the future. The skills I have demonstrated are programming, problem solving, logical thinking and electrical design. The most challenging part of the project was the research that needed to be conducted into each component to make sure we were selecting the right one, and to understand how they worked. The part which I enjoyed the most was going to the launch and seeing that the hard work and effort we put in paid off.
<br><br>

<p>
Prabhas Vedagiri - Electrical design
<br><br>During the course of the project, I learned a lot about the how microcontrollers are used and how different components can be connected to them for different applications. Along the way I used my research skills, coding knowledge and presentation skills to collate information about different components, help code them and present their application in flowchart format. What I found most challenging was interpreting component factsheets, particularly during research of different gas sensors. Unfortunately, I was unable to travel to York so I may have missed the most enjoyable moments of the project. Instead, what I found most enjoyable was learning more about how an Arduino works, so that I may learn to use them myself in future projects.

  Tathushan Subenthiran - Parachute & recovery lead
  <br><br>Over the course of this project, I have developed my ability to work in a group, as a project this vast requires an ability to cooperate with others and take on huge workloads, necessitating good time management. I also enjoyed the ability to learn more about drag and materials.
<br><br>


</p>

<p>
  Ishaan Makkar - Parachute system
<br><br>This project was an exciting experience and the exposure to the many different challenges we faced taught us how to adapt and overcome issues in a more creative way. Furthermore, I further developed my understanding of certain topics in physics and chemistry when conducting my research for the parachute and the secondary mission. As well as this, skills such as time management and working as a team have been improved through this project.

<br><br>

<p>
  Dulain Gamage - Parachute system
  <br><br>Although calculations involving drag were unfamiliar, I enjoyed the challenge of forming and using equations that I had not previously encountered. It also was rewarding to see that the results of my calculations had practical applications in the launch. Lastly, I learnt the importance of approximations and graphing as they were vital when handling complex expressions.

<br><br>

<p> 
  Mann Patira - Outreach, CanSat design, programming, report writing
  <br><br>The process of choosing and designing an appropriate secondary mission was extremely rewarding, it taught me a great many things about a variety of different topics, but most significantly, it taught me the importance of planning and research to ensure success.
